- Our website is fully controllable via keyboard such as using `Tab` to jump between each interoperable component.
- We add some `aria-label`s for icon-only buttons.
- We add tooltips if the button is not intuitive enough.
- When user register/login/create new list/edit new list, we will validate the input and display corresponding error
  messages if the input is invalid.
- For each group of form inputs, we clearly indicate the label.
- For each image, we always have an `alt` attribution to tell what is this image about concisely.
