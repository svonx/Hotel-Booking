## Basic work

Backend which contains basic functions is provided by the course convenor, and you will need to implement the frontend
in a group of 2. Functions in `REQUIREMENT.md` are completed by another group member and me, only `2.6.4` is not
achieved, also no advanced functions. The final mark for this project is 94.9/100.

## Advanced work

This part is personal work. Now backend is modified so the project can achieve advanced functions in `BONUS.md`.
